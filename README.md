# Bike Share Analysis
This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on US bike share data across 3 major cities (Washington, New York, Chicago), sourced from bike share system provider, Motivate.
The objective of this project is to utilise Python to gain exposure to the steps taken in the data analysis process.
This will primarily involve data wrangling and computing descriptive statistics.

The analysis will be performed and presented within a Jupyter notebook (also saved as PDF and HTML), with the appropriate use and understanding of the following characteristics:
 - data types (numbers, strings, etc.);
 - functions and conditional statements;
 - data structures and loops; and
 - Python modules
 
 The steps taken to conduct this analysis will include:
  - Investigating and querying the data, posing two questions which can be readily answered from EDA;
  - Reviewing the data structure and cleaning the dataset to maintain data quality and integrity, assuring the overall data consistency, completeness and validity;
  - Using descriptive statistics to answer the posed questions;
  - Present insightful data visualisations; and
  - Communicate findings (i.e. infer meaningful observations) in a conclusion statement.
